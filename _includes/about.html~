 You heard about it on the radio, you saw it on television and you 
finally decided to buy some Bitcoins. The question that you may be 
asking yourself now is, What can I do with Bitcoins? Well, you have a 
few options. You can buy things online and offline, just like you can 
with any other currency. Many virtual and physical stores are now 
accepting Bitcoins and more pop up every day.</p>

              <p align="left"><font class="gre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can save it in your Bitcoin wallet for safe keeping or a rainy day. </font>Bitcoin
 is great for saving because there are no banks involved. You are you 
own bank, banker and customer. However, there is a third option, you can
 invest it. Bitcoin is a currency and you can invest it as such. Think 
about it, when you have spare money in the bank, what is the best thing 
to do with it to make it grow. Invest it! Bitcoin is no different. 
Bitcoin has open markets where thousands of Bitcoins are bought and sold
 every day.</p>

              <p align="left"><font class="gre">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All you have to do is invest. </font>The
 problem is markets can be tricky and difficult at times to learn and to
 make money. Also, because Bitcoin is global, the markets never close. 
They are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year and 
monitoring your investments constantly can be difficult and tiresome.
